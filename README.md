## 🚀 Why OrcBot?

OrcBot is a next-generation **autonomous reasoning agent**. Unlike simple chatbots, OrcBot uses a **ReAct reasoning loop** to think in multiple steps, execute background tasks, browse the web, and manage its own system. It doesn't just reply; it **orchestrates**.

### Key Capabilities

*   🧠 **ReAct Reasoning Loop**: Thinks, Acts, and Observes in multi-step cycles to complete complex tasks.
*   🌐 **Built-in Web Browser**: Surfs the web via Playwright to find real-time info.
*   🐚 **Shell Execution**: Can run command-line tools, manage files, and install dependencies.
*   🧠 **Autonomous Learning**: Automatically updates `USER.md` (your profile) and `.AI.md` (its identity) as it learns.
*   💓 **Autonomy Heartbeat**: Proactively wakes up to self-reflect and take action even when idle.
*   🖥️ **Interactive TUI**: Streamlined terminal interface for high-level management.
*   🔌 **Self-Learning Plugin System**: Drop `.ts` or `.js` files into the `plugins/` directory to live-load new capabilities.
*   🧠 **Autonomous Skill Building**: The agent can autonomously research, write, and install its own skills using the `create_custom_skill` power.

## 🧠 The Reasoning Loop (ReAct)

OrcBot doesn't just give one answer. It works iteratively:
1.  **THOUGHT**: "I need to find news first."
2.  **ACTION**: Calls `web_search`.
3.  **OBSERVATION**: Receives news results.
4.  **RE-REASON**: "Now I should update the user's profile and then reply."
5.  **FINALIZE**: Completes background tasks and then messages the user.
